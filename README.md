# dynamicload
## A library of c functions and c++ objects built on these functions for (mostly) platform independant dynamic loading from .dll &amp; .so files
### by Fluffykins Allmighty, IDT

As of yet, this library has not been tested on windows systems, and only supports 3 types of unix-like system otherwise, as far as I've tested

**on unix, to install, enter the directory in terminal and type:**
```sh
make build && make install && make clean
```
**to build and run tests, enter example directory and type:**
```sh
make run && make clean
```
